&lt;p&gt;So here I am again, trying to make this actually happen. A few things have changed that might tip the scales in my direction. &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;A new site generator&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got fed up with fighting a packaging ecosystem I didn't know well in a language I didn't understand, so I picked this up and took it from Octopress to Pelican. So far there seems to be actively less magic (mostly because I can probably read Makefiles and Python much more natively) and it was easy enough to port.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://jakevdp.github.io/blog/2013/05/07/migrating-from-octopress-to-pelican/"&gt;Credit to an old friend's blog post&lt;/a&gt; showing up unexpectedly in Google results while I tried to work through the port ðŸ˜„&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Publish independently&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On both Patrick's and Fred's advice, I'm going to try and have this website be the first publishing platform and, where it seems useful, I can syndicate out elsewhere. Seems that &lt;a href="https://help.medium.com/hc/en-us/articles/217991468-SEO-and-duplicate-content"&gt;importing content into Medium w/ canonical links isn't too hard&lt;/a&gt;, so I got that going for me. In some ways it seems a shame to lose the &lt;a href="https://medium.com/@scott_triglia"&gt;very small amount of momentum I had on Medium&lt;/a&gt;, but I suppose that makes it cheaper to do now than later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Publish often&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If history is any indication, this will be the hard part. I've had a pretty good run publishing nearly-weekly posts internal to Yelp in the last 3 months or so, but I've been quite awful at putting them out on the greater internet. That seems like a shame in retrospect, because I've often been frustrated at the extreme rarity of any decent writing on technical leadership for non-managers.  Except this week of course - see &lt;a href="https://blog.jessfraz.com/post/defining-a-distinguished-engineer/"&gt;Jessie Frazelle's excellent post on distinguished engineers&lt;/a&gt; which has immediately become my new favorite post describing the holistic set of skills behind excellent senior engineers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And to better defend my ability to publish often, there's probably going to be a bias here to just text and links for a while. Something I can crank out in a markdown editor without worrying about any technical issues and throw onto the website without effort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;So here's to nothing?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wish me luck -- we'll see if a better generator, some reaffirmed intent, and a coat of new paint do the trick.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>"A New Year"</title><link href="http://www.locallyoptimal.com/blog/2013/01/12/a-new-year/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2013-01-12T15:54:00-08:00</published><updated>2013-01-12T15:54:00-08:00</updated><author><name>Scott Triglia</name></author><id>tag:www.locallyoptimal.com,2013-01-12:/blog/2013/01/12/a-new-year/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;All the cool kids wrote New Year posts, so I figured that was excuse enough for me to chime in with a quick one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Writing here has been a nice outlet for the end of 2012, but I figure now's as good a time as any to make a couple minor changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, I'm going to actually bother telling people this exists. Theoretically I was waiting until I was more comfortable with the writing, or until I decided this would actually be of interest to other people, or some other unspecified timeâ€¦but better now than not at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, I'm planning on publishing a lot more short, one-off posts with little snippets of code I've found useful. Back in grad school I found many a solution in the tiny posts &lt;a href="http://desk.stinkpot.org:8080/tricks/"&gt;from the desk of Stinkpot&lt;/a&gt; and would love to save other people some frustration in the same way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So Happy New Year and here's to a great 2013.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>"First things first"</title><link href="http://www.locallyoptimal.com/blog/2012/08/31/first-things-first/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2012-08-31T23:53:00-07:00</published><updated>2012-08-31T23:53:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Scott Triglia</name></author><id>tag:www.locallyoptimal.com,2012-08-31:/blog/2012/08/31/first-things-first/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;As all good internet citizens do eventually, I've decided to try writing down
