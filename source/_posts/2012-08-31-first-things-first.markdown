As all good internet citizens do eventually, I've decided to try writing down
my various software-related trials and tribulations down in a blog. For the
time being, I'm sticking with Octopress as I care more about the content than
the web design. Maybe later this will become an exercise in web
development...but not quite yet.

Expect a lot of posts where I walk through some task or tool that I've been
using recently. Hopefully you'll find it interesting.
