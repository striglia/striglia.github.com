    <p><p>We all make mistakesâ€¦some more embarrassing than others in hindsight. I always really appreciate when programmers I look up to make a point of pointing out their own faults, so I figured it was only fair for me to do the same.</p>
<p>So in that spirit, let's talk about where I've gone wrong! Looking back on the tests I've written in the last six months has made me realize several things I'd change if I could write them again.</p>

    <p><p>All the cool kids wrote New Year posts, so I figured that was excuse enough for me to chime in with a quick one.</p>
<p>Writing here has been a nice outlet for the end of 2012, but I figure now's as good a time as any to make a couple â€¦</p></p>

    </h2>
    <p><p>Very reliably, my favorite part of programming is the simple process of taking a series of steps that I used to have to do by hand and packaging it up in a nice, reusable form. It's pretty wonderful that it remains just as rewarding now as it did when I wrote my first function in C++ 8 years ago.</p>
<p>So in that spirit, I figured I'd write down a few thoughts on python's context managers -- the latest built-in feature that I've grown quite attached to. </p>

    <p><p>More than any other area, I've found software testing to be the discipline which I knew the least about before joining up at Yelp full time. Sure, there was the normal insistence in my time as an undergraduate that I learn how to test units of code, and I'd heard plenty about the value of unit testing from any number of people or blogs, but when it came right down to it relatively few people I knew ever employed it to a meaningful degree during college and my graduate work. The simple truth was that projects rarely lasted long enough for the fruits of proper testing to be borne out.</p>
<p>Now I am sure plenty of people would disagree with that statement, pointing to how their various school projects were made better or simpler by judicious application of unit tests, but the goal of this post isn't arguing about whether or not testing is worthwhile. My goal is to dive in a little bit to one particular area of testing that I had essentially zero exposure to before joining industry -- the mocking of methods in tests.</p>

    </h2>
    <p><p>If you had asked me to explain all I knew about Python's namedtuple class at
the start of this year, I would have probably muttered something about
mutability and trailed off into an uncomfortable silence. The fact of the
matter was, I had seen them used once or twice but never really understood the
reason they were used. Hopefully by the end of this entry I can explain at
least a couple of places you might consider using them over the typical Python
class.</p>

    <p><p>As all good internet citizens do eventually, I've decided to try writing down
my various software-related trials and tribulations down in a blog. For the
time being, I'm sticking with Octopress as I care more about the content than
the web design. Maybe later this will become an exercise in â€¦</p></p>
