<h2>A new site generator</h2>
<p>I got fed up with fighting a packaging ecosystem I didn't know well in a language I didn't understand, so I picked this up and took it from Octopress to Pelican. So far there seems to be actively less magic (mostly because I can probably read Makefiles and Python much more natively) and it was easy enough to port.</p>
<p><a href="https://jakevdp.github.io/blog/2013/05/07/migrating-from-octopress-to-pelican/">Credit to an old friend's blog post</a> showing up unexpectedly in Google results while I tried to work through the port ðŸ˜„</p>
<h2>Publish independently</h2>
<p>On both Patrick's and Fred's advice, I'm going to try and have this website be the first publishing platform and, where it seems useful, I can syndicate out elsewhere. Seems that <a href="https://help.medium.com/hc/en-us/articles/217991468-SEO-and-duplicate-content">importing content into Medium w/ canonical links isn't too hard</a>, so I got that going for me. In some ways it seems a shame to lose the <a href="https://medium.com/@scott_triglia">very small amount of momentum I had on Medium</a>, but I suppose that makes it cheaper to do now than later.</p>
<h2>Publish often</h2>
<p>If history is any indication, this will be the hard part. I've had a pretty good run publishing nearly-weekly posts internal to Yelp in the last 3 months or so, but I've been quite awful at putting them out on the greater internet. That seems like a shame in retrospect, because I've often been frustrated at the extreme rarity of any decent writing on technical leadership for non-managers.  Except this week of course - see <a href="https://blog.jessfraz.com/post/defining-a-distinguished-engineer/">Jessie Frazelle's excellent post on distinguished engineers</a> which has immediately become my new favorite post describing the holistic set of skills behind excellent senior engineers.</p>
<p>And to better defend my ability to publish often, there's probably going to be a bias here to just text and links for a while. Something I can crank out in a markdown editor without worrying about any technical issues and throw onto the website without effort.</p>
<h3>So here's to nothing?</h3>
<p>Wish me luck -- we'll see if a better generator, some reaffirmed intent, and a coat of new paint do the trick.</p>
